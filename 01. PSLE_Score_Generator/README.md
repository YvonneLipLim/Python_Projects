# PSLE Score Generator

This is a Python program that takes the scores for Mathematics, Science, English, Mother Tongue and Higher Mother Tongue as input from the user. Based on their scores, determine the Achievement Levels (ALs) for each subject using the 8 ALs scoring bands. 

**The ALs for the mark range will be as follows:**
* 90 & Above = AL1
* 85 - 89 = AL2
* 80 - 84 = AL3
* 75 - 79 = AL4
* 65 - 74 = AL5
* 45 - 64 = AL6
* 20 - 44 = AL7
* 20 & Below = AL8

**Higher Mother Tongue results will reflect the following:**
* 80 - 100 = Distinction
* 65 - 79 = Merit
* 50 - 64 = Pass
Then, add together the AL of the 4 subjects to form the PSLE score, which ranges from 4 to 32, with 4 being the best possible total score by scoring at least 90 marks for all four subjects.

**Finally, use the PSLE Score to determine the placement stream as follows:**
* 4 - 20 = Express
* 21- 22 = Express / Normal (Academic)
* 23 - 24 = Normal (Academic)
* 25 = Normal (Academic) / Normal (Technical)
* 26-30 = Normal (Technical) with AL7 or better in both English and Math
