### Project criteria:
1. What was the most frequent movie duration in the 1990s? Save an approximate answer as an integer called duration (use 1990 as the decade's start year).

2. A movie is considered short if it is less than 90 minutes. Count the number of short action movies released in the 1990s and save this integer as short_movie_count.

### Solutions approach:
1. What type of Python libraries to import?
2. How to load the CSV file into Python?
3. How to get data from 1990 and 1999?
4. How to find the most frequent movie duration?
5. How to count the total number of short action movies from the 1990s?
